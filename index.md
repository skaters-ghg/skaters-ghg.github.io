# SKATERS
_**S**cientists for **K**nowledge of **AT**mospheric inv**ERS**ions_

**SKATERS** is an open, collaborative community for scientists working on **inverse modeling of atmospheric trace gases**.  
We connect researchers who want to share methods, code, data, and experiences â€” especially those who might be the only person in their group using these techniques.

Because inverse modeling is a specialized and evolving field, our members often face unique technical and methodological challenges. SKATERS is here to help bridge those gaps by providing a space to learn from one another, ask questions, and collaborate.

## What we offer
1. **Monthly one-hour online meetings** featuring deep-dive presentations and open discussions on inversion methods.
2. A place to **share code, data, and resources** related to atmospheric inversions.
3. A **community of peers** who can help troubleshoot issues, share best practices, and provide feedback on your work.
4. A platform to **announce job postings** and opportunities relevant to our members.
5. A **mailing list** for announcements and community updates
