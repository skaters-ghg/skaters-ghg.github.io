# SKATERS
_Scientists for Knowledge of ATmospheric invERSions_

SKATERS is a community of researchers focused on **inverse modeling methods of trace gases in the atmosphere**.  
We share methods, datasets, and practical lessons from real-world applications.

## What we do
- Host discussions on inversion frameworks (analytical, variational, ensemble, MCMC, and machine learning approaches).
- Have regular meetings to present research progress and get feedback.
- Share ideas, knowledge, and resources for atmospheric inversions.

## Join us
