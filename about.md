## About SKATERS

**SKATERS** (Scientists for Knowledge of ATmospheric invERsionS) is an open group dedicated to advancing inverse modeling of atmospheric trace gases. Our members include scientists, students, and practitioners working on topics such as:

- Observation-constrained flux estimation (e.g., methane, CO₂, nitrous oxide)
- Transport modeling and atmospheric chemistry
- Retrievals, error characterization, and uncertainty quantification
- Data assimilation, optimization, and adjoint modeling
- Benchmarking and open, reproducible workflows

### Principles
- **Open science** — share code, methods, and data whenever possible.
- **Reproducibility** — emphasize transparent, testable workflows.
- **Community** — encourage collaboration and respectful discussion across institutions and career stages.

### Activities
- Regular discussion sessions on methods and papers
- Hands-on tutorials and show-and-tells
- Community-maintained resources (reading lists, code templates, datasets)

If this resonates with you, we’d love to hear from you.
