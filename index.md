**SKATERS** is an open, collaborative community for scientists working on **inverse modeling of atmospheric trace gases**.  
We connect researchers who want to share methods, code, data, and experiences â€” especially those who might be the only person in their group using these techniques.

Because inverse modeling is a specialized and evolving field, our members often face unique technical and methodological challenges. SKATERS is here to help bridge those gaps by providing a space to learn from one another, ask questions, and collaborate.
